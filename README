This distribution contains an introcuction/guide/tutorial to HTTP/1.1
header writing for mod_perl users. It will probably end up in the
mod_perl distribution, but as long as it is in flux, it's probably
better to have it as a standalone distribution file.

There's no code contained in the distribution. The guide can be
installed like the manpage of a perl module by running

    perl Makefile.PL
    make install

You can read the document then with

    man Apache::correct_headers

Enjoy,
